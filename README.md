### Encrypt and decrypt strings on modules
<p>At first we make another RX/TX pins manually by <strong>including "SoftwareSerial" header</strong>.</p>
<p>We can then input a string into the board and view it encrypted in our own RX/TX and decrypt it again in the original RX/TX of the board.</p>
<p>Encrypts and decrypts are done using the <strong>"AESlib" header</strong> and can be designed and complex.</p>
<p>All these explanations can be viewed as tested in the video of test folder.</p>
